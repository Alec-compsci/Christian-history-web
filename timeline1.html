                    <p> 
                        Jesus of Nazareth, also known as Jesus Christ, is born in Bethlehem. According to Christian belief, he is the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. His birth is celebrated by Christians worldwide on December 25th, known as Christmas.

                    <p>
                        This was during the reign of King Herod the Great, who, according to the Gospel of Matthew, ordered the Massacre of the Innocents in an attempt to kill the infant Jesus. This is why Jesus' family fled to Egypt for a little while before Herod's death. They later returned to Nazareth in Galilee, where Jesus grew up.

                    <p>
                        Jesus begins his public ministry around the age of 30, preaching about the Kingdom of God, performing miracles, and gathering his disciples. His teachings emphasize love, forgiveness, and repentance. He gains a significant following but also faces opposition from religious leaders.

                    <p>
                        Around 30-33 AD, Jesus is crucified under the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, under the pressure of the religious leaders. Christians believe that his death serves as a sacrifice for the sins of humanity. According to Christian doctrine, Jesus is resurrected three days after his crucifixion, an event celebrated as Easter, signifying victory over sin and death, and proving his divine nature. He later ascended to heaven, promising to return in the future.

                    <p>
                        Soon after Jesus' ascension, the pentecost occurs, where the Holy Spirit descends upon the apostles, empowering them to spread Jesus' teachings. This event is often considered the "birthday" of the Christian Church. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The apostles would engage in missionary work, spreading Christianity throughout the Roman Empire and beyond. Key figures during this period include Peter and Paul, who played significant roles in establishing early Christian communities and writing letters (epistles) that would later become part of the New Testament. Paul was originally a persecutor of Christians but converted after a profound spiritual experience.
